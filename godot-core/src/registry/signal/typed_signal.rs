/// Type-safe version of a Godot signal.
///
/// Short-lived type, only valid in the scope of its surrounding object type `C`, for lifetime `'c`. The generic argument `Ps` represents
/// the parameters of the signal, thus ensuring the type safety.
///
/// The [`WithSignals::SignalCollection`] struct returns multiple signals with distinct, code-generated types, but they all implement
/// `Deref` and `DerefMut` to `TypedSignal`. This allows you to either use the concrete APIs of the generated types, or the more generic
/// ones of `TypedSignal`.
///
/// # Connecting a signal to a receiver
/// Receiver functions are functions that are called when a signal is emitted. You can connect a signal in many different ways:
/// - [`connect()`][Self::connect] for global functions, associated functions or closures.
/// - [`connect_self()`][Self::connect_self] for methods with `&mut self` as the first parameter.
/// - [`connect()`][Self::connect] for methods with any `Gd<T>` (not `self`) as the first parameter.
/// - [`connect_builder()`][Self::connect_builder] for more complex setups.
///
/// # Emitting a signal
/// Code-generated signal types provide a method `emit(...)`, which adopts the names and types of the `#[signal]` parameter list.
/// In most cases, that's the method you are looking for.
///
/// For generic use, you can also use [`emit_tuple()`][Self::emit_tuple], which does not provide parameter names.
///
/// # More information
/// See the [Signals](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/register/signals.html) chapter in the book for a detailed introduction and examples.
